## Hotfix size and type of uploading files in ocStore(OpenCart)

A maximum file upload size is taken from server settings.

Use the option `upload_max_filesize` from file `.htaccess` or `php.ini`.

MIME-types and file's extensions are taken from store settings (Administration->System->Settings->Server).

Tested on ocStore version 1.5.5.1.2. 

**Installation**

A user manual read in a file `read.me`
