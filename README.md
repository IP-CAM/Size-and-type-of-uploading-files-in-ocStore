## Hotfix size and type of uploading files in ocStore(OpenCart)

A maximum file upload size is taken from server settings (php.ini variable `upload_max_filesize = 100M`).

MIME-type and file extension are taken from the store settings (Administration->System->Settings->Server).

Tested on ocStore version 1.5.5.1.2. 

**Installation**

Read the file `read.me`
