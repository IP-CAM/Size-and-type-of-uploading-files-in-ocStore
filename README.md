## Size and type of uploading files in ocStore(OpenCart)
---
####This is a modification for ocStore(opencart shop) uses the store settings and the server settings to upload files.

A maximum file upload size is equal to the option `upload_max_filesize` file `.htaccess` or `php.ini`.

>`.htaccess` has higher priority than `php.ini`

MIME types and file's extensions are taken from store settings (Administration->System->Settings->Server).

Tested on ocStore version 1.5.5.1.2. 

Perhaps suitable for all versions of 1.5.x.
